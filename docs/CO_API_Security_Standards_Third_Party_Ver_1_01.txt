Extraction for Third-Party API Security


1.   Security Requirements
     For additional security, the following security measures were implemented to ensure the
     utmost protection of data and privacy.


     1.1.   Http Basic Authentication

            HTTP authentication headers

            If the user's name is "test", and the password is the string "123" followed by the
            Unicode character U+00A3 (POUND SIGN). Using the character encoding scheme
            UTF-8, the user-pass becomes:

               't' 'e' 's' 't' ':' '1' '2' '3' pound
               74 65 73 74 3A 31 32 33 C2 A3

            Encoding this octet sequence in Base64 ([RFC4648], Section 4) yields:
            dGVzdDoxMjPCow==

            The Authorization header field would be:
               Authorization: Basic dGVzdDoxMjPCow==



     1.2.   SSL Client Certificate
            Two way SSL, also known as mutual SSL certificates, are SSL certificates where
            the server and the client authenticate each other for a more robust security.

            It is required to obtain a valid TLS certificate for the Client, this is the integration
            partner’s own responsibility.

            It is crucial to select the hostnames with care to ensure the accurate creation of the
            certificate.

            The technical network specialists on both sides will coordinate to confirm the
            hostnames.

            Depending on the programming language and framework you're using, the specific
            implementation steps may vary. However, the general approach is as follows:

        ●   Load Client Certificate and Key: Load the client's certificate and private key into
            your application. These are typically stored in files (e.g., PEM, PFX/P12) or
            keystores (e.g., JKS).
        ●   Enable mTLS: Configure your application to use mTLS when establishing a
            connection with the server. This typically involves specifying the location of the client
            certificate and key, as well as any necessary truststore settings to verify the server's
            certificate.




  1.3.      Digital signing
            The integration partner will be provided a Client Identifier with a secret. This is used
            to append additional HTTP headers that serve as a digital signature. Please see
            headers below:

            [Header_Prefix]_CLIENTID
               ● Description: This header contains a unique identifier assigned by us to the
                  client for authentication and tracking purposes.
               ● Type: String
               ● Example: [Header_Prefix]_CLIENTID:
                  94C132DE-136E-14EF-9154-4287C0A8140C
               ● Required: Yes

            [Header_Prefix]_DTS
               ● Description: This header represents the Date Time Stamp of the request. It
                  should be set to the current timestamp when the request is made.
               ● Type: String (ISO 8601 format)
               ● Example: [Header_Prefix]_DTS: 2024-05-16 11:56:51.155
               ● Required: Yes

            [Header_Prefix]_HSH
               ● Description: This header contains a Hash-based Message Authentication
                  Code (HMAC) value. The client generates this HMAC value for each request
                  to ensure data integrity and authenticity using HMACSHA512 cryptographic
                  hash function. A Client Secret for this ClientID will be provided to use for this
                  function
               ● Type: String
               ● Example: [Header_Prefix]_HSH:
                      ○ Concatenate [Header_Prefix]_CLIENTID and [Header_Prefix]_DTS:


Unset
               HMACSHA512_String = “94C132DE-136E-14EF-9154-4287C0A8140C” +
               “2024-05-16 11:56:51.155”


                       ●   Call a function, for example. hmac_sha512(secret, message)
                       ●   Example Client Secret : "Roj=Zw4$#jpiK9nx"
Unset
            secret = "Roj=Zw4$#jpiK9nx"
            hmac_value = hmac_sha512(secret, HMACSHA512_String)




                     ●   Perform base64 encoding on hmac_value


Unset
                     base64_encoded_hmac_value = base64encode(hmac_value)


                     ●   [Header_Prefix]_HSH = base64_encoded_hmac_value


Unset
            eg.    then will be
            [Header_Prefix]_HSH =
            “L/QM1h/9ijHn1iI+SvV7hq216rRgW16XcMbbrR7/ufOkO69fO/bp5CceeAl9wXdMFGcj
            px4fMunT39mRwhVTSQ==”




            ●     Required: Yes


  1.4.   IP Address White Listing
         The integration partner must provide the IP address of the server(s) that will access
         UAT and Production. The REST endpoints will check the incoming request IP
         address against the configured allowed IP address list.
